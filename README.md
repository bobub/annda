# annda
Contains code to support assignments from ANN and Deep Arch course. Each Lab focused on the following:

Lab 1: Implement MLPs and autoencoders and apply them to time series prediction.

Lab 2: Implement and apply RBFs and Self Organising Maps for the traveling salesman problem, Swedish MP vote clustering, and topological ordering.

Lab 3: Implement and apply Hopfield Networks for image denoising and reconstruction.

Lab 4: Implement RBMs and Deep Belief Nets and apply it to image classification and generation.
